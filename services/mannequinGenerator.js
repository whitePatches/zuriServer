CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- For items with reference images: REPLICATE them exactly as shown (colors, patterns, style, fit)
- For missing items: CREATE complementary pieces that work harmoniously with the provided items
- Ensure all generated items are appropriate for the specified occasion: ${occasion}
- Maintain color coordination and style consistency across all items
- Consider the user's undertone (${
      userUnderTone || "neutral"
    }) when selecting colors for generated items
- If only some items are provided, make sure the AI-generated items complement and enhance the user's choices

}

VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Generate a realistic **Indian** female model with ${
      userBodyShape || "balanced"
    } body shape and ${heightString} height proportions
- The model should represent how the outfit would realistically look on someone with the user's body type
- Model pose: Confident, natural stance with good posture that showcases the outfit on the specific body shape
- Styling: Ensure proper fit that flatters the user's body shape, with attention to proportions
- Aesthetic: Modern, polished, and fashion-forward appearance suitable for the user's body type
- Background: Clean, minimalist backdrop in neutral tones (white, light gray, or soft beige)
- Lighting: Professional studio lighting with soft shadows to highlight outfit details and body silhouette
- Image quality: High-resolution, sharp focus on clothing details and overall composition

BODY-SPECIFIC STYLING FOCUS:
- Demonstrate how the outfit flatters the ${
      userBodyShape || "balanced"
    } body shape
- Show proper proportions and fit for someone of ${heightString} height
- Ensure the styling choices work well with the user's body type for a realistic preview
- Focus on creating a look that the user would actually achieve with their body characteristics

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Maintain elegance and sophistication appropriate for ${occasion}
- Ensure color harmony that works with ${userUnderTone || "neutral"} undertones
- Consider balanced proportions between provided and generated items for the user's body type
- Consider current fashion trends while maintaining timeless appeal
- Focus on creating a cohesive, well-curated look that works specifically for the user's body shape
- The final outfit should look intentionally styled for the user's body type, not generic styling

    } shape, ${heightString} height, ${
      userUnderTone || "neutral"
    } undertone), providing an accurate and personalized preview of the styled look.

Style the model to embody confidence and grace while accurately representing the user's body type, showcasing how this complete outfit would realistically look for ${occasion}${
